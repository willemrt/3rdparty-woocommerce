# WooCommerce PiwikPRO Integration (bug fixed)

I went ahead and got someone to fix this plugin. It cost me $200. 

If you want you can send a paypal donation to willem_rt@yahoo.com.au with PIWIK Woocommerce in the notes somewhere and ill put it in a fund to help with any future bug fixes/improvements that we may need to keep us all running smoothly. 



WordPress plugin: Provides the integration between WooCommerce and PiwikPRO.

Will be required for WooCommerce shops using the integration from WooCommerce 2.1 and up.
